# Text-Encryption-Decryption
A Rail-Fence text cipher

This text cipher encrypts messages using a zig-zag pattern, known as rail-fence cipher. It gets as input a key, and puts the words in zig-zag in a puzzle as in the next picture.
We can see how the message THISISASECRETMESSAGE, given with key 5, is put into that 2-D matrix and is then encrypted bythe message TESHSCSAIAREGSSEMEIT.
